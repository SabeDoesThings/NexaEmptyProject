# NexaEmptyProject
empty project for my library [Nexa](https://github.com/SabeDoesThings/Nexa)

# Install
download the latest release because this has all the files needed to use nexa.
You don't need to worry about the SDL dlls and the include and lib folder's those are just for nexa to work. You just need to worry about the src folder and any folder you make yourself.
